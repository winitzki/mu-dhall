    "Evaluation in µDhall is based on applying just three rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Evaluate all function applications by substituting variables.\n",
    "- Evaluate built-in operations and functions (for example, `10 + 20` or `Natural/subtract 1 2`) according to their specific meaning.\n",
    "- If the result still contains any lambdas, rename all bound variables to `_` and introduce enough de Bruijn indices to disambiguate name clashes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluation will take a µDhall expression and produce an equivalent expression in the \"normal form\". The normal form cannot be evaluated any further. In most cases, the normal form will be a simple value (say, a `Natural` number).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, `(λ(y : Natural) → x + 10) 123` is evaluated to the normal form `133`.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in some cases the normal form is not a simple value but a function; and it can even be longer than the initial expression.\n",
    "This is because evaluation in µDhall is _symbolic_. In µDhall, functions are applied even under lambda where some operands are variable symbols.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, this expression:\n",
    "\n",
    "     λ(x : Natural) → (λ(y : Natural) → x + y) 123\n",
    "\n",
    "is evaluated to the normal form `λ(_ : Natural) → _ + 123`. We have simplified `(λ(y : Natural) → x + y) 123` to `x + 123`, while `x` remains a variable symbol. Then we renamed `x` to `_`, replacing `λ(x : Natural) → x + 123` by `λ(_ : Natural) → _ + 123`.\n",
    "\n",
    "When bound variables are renamed to `_`, we will introduce de Bruijn indices whenever we have to avoid a name clash. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "     λ(a : Type) → λ(b : Type) → a\n",
    "\n",
    "is renamed to:\n",
    "\n",
    "     λ(_ : Type) → λ(_ : Type) → _@1\n",
    "\n",
    "If the variable `_` is already present, we may also need to increment its de Bruijn index:\n",
    "\n",
    "     λ(x : Type) → _\n",
    "\n",
    "will become:\n",
    "\n",
    "     λ(_ : Type) → _@1\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluating by substition is called **beta-normalization**. Renaming bound variables is called **alpha-normalization**.\n",
    "\n",
    "We specify the formal rules for these normalization operations using the \"proof notation\". We denote by `a ↦ b` a proof that the alpha-normalization of `a` will give `b`, and by `a ⇥ b` a proof that the beta-normalization of `a` will give `b`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the beta-normalization rules for adding natural numbers look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "l ⇥ NaturalLiteral(0)   r₀ ⇥ r₁\n",
    "───────────────────────────────\n",
    "l + r₀ ⇥ r₁\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "l₀ ⇥ l₁   r ⇥ NaturalLiteral(0)\n",
    "───────────────────────────────\n",
    "l₀ + r ⇥ l₁\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "l ⇥ NaturalLiteral(m)   r ⇥ NaturalLiteral(m)\n",
    "─────────────────────────────────────────────  ; Here \"m + n\" means \"use built-in addition of integers\".\n",
    "l + r ⇥ NaturalLiteral(m + n)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "l₀ ⇥ l₁   r₀ ⇥ r₁\n",
    "─────────────────  ; If no other rule matches.\n",
    "l₀ + r₀ ⇥ l₁ + r₁\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These four rules show how to compute the beta-normalization for any expression of the form `a + b`. We will need to specify how these operations work with all possible expression structures. This will allow us to translate the specification directly into code."
