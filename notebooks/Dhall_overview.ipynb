    "Dhall is a purely functional configuration language.\n",
    "\n",
    "The official site [dhall-lang.org](https://dhall-lang.org) contains user documentation, while the [github repository](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-lang/blob/master/standard/) contains a formal specification of the language, intended for developers.\n",

    "\n",
    "     let f = λ(x : Natural) → λ(y : Natural) → x + y + 2\n",

    "Main features of Dhall:\n",
    "\n",
    "- simple syntax, everything is a statically typed expression\n",
    "- few built-in types and functions (`Natural`, `Bool`, `Text`, `Optional`, `List`, and some others)\n",
    "- safety: no side effects, no mutation, no exceptions, no partial functions\n",
    "- a very powerful type system: Dhall implements System F-omega but treats types similarly to values, has structurally typed records and unions, and basic support for dependent types\n",
    "- restricted computations: no general recursion, no general string comparison\n",
    "- file-based module system with safe imports\n",
    "\n",
    "Main use case for Dhall is to represent at once an entire JSON or YAML configuration file and its data schema with some validations.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Dhall script for a small configuration file could look like this:\n",

    "     let Text/nonEmpty = ./text-utils/Text/nonEmpty.dhall\n",
    "     let Natural/greaterThan = https://prelude.dhall-lang.org/Natural/greaterThan\n",

    "     }\n",

    "This script can be run via `dhall-json` or `dhall-yaml` utilities to generate JSON or YAML configuration files. Those files will not be generated if any validations fail (the `assert` expressions)."
