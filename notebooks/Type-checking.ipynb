    "Type-checking is a procedure where we determine whether a given µDhall expression has a well-defined type. If so, we will have \"inferred\" that type and found that the expression is \"well-typed\". Otherwise, the expression will be considered as \"ill-typed\" (having a type error), and we will reject that expression as invalid and report the error to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type-checking is a necessary step before evaluating any expressions: only well-typed expressions will be evaluated.\n",
    "\n",
    "In µDhall, type-checking is simple. The user needs to specify the types in all lambda functions, and expressions may not be recursive. So, any variable contained in a valid expression already has a specified type.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider this expression:\n",
    "\n",
    "     λ(x : Natural) → x + y\n",
    "\n",
    "When we look at the sub-expression `x + y`, we already know that `x` has type `Natural`. If `y` is undefined (a free variable), we cannot type-check this. So, we stop with a type error due to an undefined variable. If `y` has been bound in some lambda in an outer scope (such as `λ(y : T) → ...`) then we will know the type `T` that has been assigned to `y`. Then we need to verify that the operation `+` is well-typed: both its operands must have type `Natural`. In this case, we need to verify that `T` is `Natural`. If this is so, the entire expression is well-typed: it is a function of type `∀(x : Natural) → Natural`. Otherwise, we will have found a type error: the operation `+` is applied to a value of type different from `Natural`. We reject the expression and show the type error to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "We see that type-checking requires us to know what types have been previously assigned to bound variables when we descend recursively into sub-expressions. This information is held as a list of type assignments such as `[ y : T, x : Natural ]`. This list is called a **type-checking context** and is often denoted by the letter Γ (\"gamma\").\n",
    "\n",
    "We also see that type-checking needs evaluation and equality comparison. In the example just shown, we need to know whether the type `T` equals `Natural`. However, `T` could be a complicated type expression involving function applications. To know whether `T` is really equal to `Natural`, we need to be able to evaluate arbitrary expressions to an unambiguous normal form. This requires us to use full alpha und beta normalization."
